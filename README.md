# Systematic Review Screening Agent

*Note: A screening agent applies protocol-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria to titles and abstracts. A dual-pass strategy is employed to ensure consistency in the AI decisions for screening, where each screening task is executed twice independently. Only when both outputs match is the decision finalised and exported into Google Sheets. The screening robustness is enhanced through cross-validation and stratified sampling. Outputs are partitioned by publication year.*

An intelligent, AI-powered tool for automating the title and abstract screening process in systematic reviews. This tool uses **browser automation with Gemini AI** to generate custom screening logic tailored to your specific research criteria.

## 🌟 Features

- **🤖 AI-Powered Customization**: Uses Google's Gemini (via browser automation) to generate sophisticated screening logic from your criteria
- **📄 Multiple Input Formats**: Define criteria in `.txt`, `.docx`, or `.json` formats
- **🧠 Intelligent Logic**: Generates nuanced decision trees with contextual exception handling, not just simple keyword matching
- **📊 BibTeX Support**: Parses `.bib` files exported from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and other databases
- **📝 Detailed Reasoning**: Provides clear explanations for every inclusion/exclusion decision
- **🔄 PRISMA-Ready**: Outputs CSV files compatible with PRISMA workflow documentation
- **🌐 No API Key Required**: Uses browser automation - just log in to Gemini once

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Google account (for Gemini access)
- Chrome or Edge browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Systematic_review_screening_agent.git
   cd Systematic_review_screening_agent
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers**:
   ```bash
   playwright install chromium
   ```

### Basic Usage

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Criteria File

Create a criteria file defining your inclusion/exclusion rules. See [Criteria File Formats](#criteria-file-formats) below.

Example (`my_criteria.txt`):
```
[DESCRIPTION]
Screening for studies on diabetes treatment in elderly patients

[INCLUSION_KEYWORDS]
Primary Topic: Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes, T2DM
Population: Elderly, Geriatric, Aged, Senior
Intervention: Treatment, Therapy, Management

[EXCLUSION_KEYWORDS]
Study Types: Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis
Other Conditions: Type 1 Diabetes, Pediatric
```

#### Step 2: Generate Custom Screening Code

The script will open a browser, log in to Gemini (first time only), and automatically generate the code:

```bash
python generate_screening_code.py my_criteria.txt
```

**First-time setup:**
- Browser will open to gemini.google.com
- Log in with your Google account (one-time)
- The script will automatically send the prompt and extract the generated code
- Generated code is saved as `screen_articles_custom.py`

#### Step 3: Prepare Your Articles

Place your BibTeX file (exported from your database) in the project folder as `articles.bib`.

#### Step 4: Parse and Screen

```bash
# Parse BibTeX to JSON
python parse_bib.py

# Run screening with your custom logic
python screen_articles_custom.py
```

#### Step 5: Review Results

Open `screening_results.csv` to see your screening results with decisions and reasoning.

## 📋 Criteria File Formats

### Text Format (.txt)

Simple, human-readable format:

```
[DESCRIPTION]
Brief description of your screening criteria

[INCLUSION_KEYWORDS]
Category Name: keyword1, keyword2, keyword3
Another Category: keyword4, keyword5

[EXCLUSION_KEYWORDS]
Study Types: Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis
Unwanted Topics: keyword6, keyword7

[MATCHING_RULES]
Case Sensitive: No
Primary Topic in Title Required: Yes
```

### JSON Format (.json)

Structured format for programmatic use:

```json
{
  "description": "Your screening criteria description",
  "inclusion": {
    "primary_topic": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    "population": ["keyword3", "keyword4"]
  },
  "exclusion": {
    "study_types": ["Systematic Review", "Meta-Analysis"],
    "unwanted_topics": ["keyword5", "keyword6"]
  },
  "rules": {
    "case_sensitive": false,
    "primary_in_title_required": true
  }
}
```

### Word Format (.docx)

Structured document with:
- **Heading 1**: Section names (Inclusion Criteria, Exclusion Criteria, Description)
- **Heading 2**: Category names (Primary Topic, Population, etc.)
- **Bullet points**: Individual keywords

See `examples/` folder for complete examples.

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Using the Original Hardcoded Version

If you want to use the original hardcoded screening logic (for Giant Cell Tumor in Cervical Spine):

```bash
python parse_bib.py
python screen_articles.py
```

### Customizing Generated Code

After generating `screen_articles_custom.py`, you can manually edit it to fine-tune the logic if needed.

### Testing Your Criteria

Use the example files to test your setup:

```bash
python generate_screening_code.py examples/example_criteria.txt screen_test.py
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Criteria Parsing**: Your criteria file is parsed into a structured format
2. **AI Code Generation**: Gemini API analyzes your criteria and the reference code to generate sophisticated screening logic
3. **Smart Screening**: The generated code applies nuanced decision-making:
   - Hierarchical exclusion rules
   - Contextual exception handling
   - Title vs. abstract weighting
   - Complex boolean logic for competing topics
4. **Detailed Output**: Each article gets a decision (Include/Exclude) with clear reasoning
